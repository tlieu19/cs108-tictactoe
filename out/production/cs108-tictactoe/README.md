# CS108 Extra Credits Assignment: Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
Your job is to create a file called "ComputerPlayer", and it would implement the Player interface.
Just make sure that you have a constructor like so:
```ComputerPlayer(char computerCharacter, String name)```
where `computerCharacter` is either `X` or `O` to indicate what character the computer can play, and `name` is the name given to the computer.

The `name` field is used for a couple of reasons:
* Helps to distinguish if a player is human or a computer
* Helps me to have 2 computer players but with different names

## Rubric
1. Playable game (with or without recursion): 10 pts
1. Playable game with recursion: 10 pts
1. "Smart" opponent (i.e. select a "best" move using a evaluation criteria): 10 pts
1. Indicate why a move is selected (maybe show the "value" of each move): 10 pts
1. Computer can play as X or O: 10 pts
1. Computer can play against my own computer algorithm (no need to win, just be able to play): 10 pts
1. Well documented code (code should not need explanation from you in person): 10 pts

## Weightage
You can get up to **10%** of your overall grade if you complete all of the items mentioned in the rubric.
A lot of incentive but it is a correspondingly harder assignment as well.
Try to do at least the first few items in the rubric: it will only help your grade.
